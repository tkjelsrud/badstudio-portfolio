Every lines is straight
and your cheeks glow
Nothing will stick
Nothing can grow

Still every
eye is upon you

Dreams drift farther away
each time night calls
Dreams drift farther away

pull my dream
down from stars
I won't expect more

I'll find infite ways
In which I'll berate myself
Two hands, eyes closed
abstract top shelf

(watching you)
do blank canvas
shows all
by yourself

(dust
settles on the shelf)

I'll trade 
all my dreams 
for a still life

I'm loosing touch
Watching it solidify

And when we cross that line
Every eye is upon you
