Every lines is straight
and your cheeks glow
Nothing will stick
Nothing can grow

Still every
eye is upon you

Dreams drift farther away
each time night calls
Dreams drift farther away

We build our world
out of stars
Can we expect more?

I'll find infite ways
In which I'll berate myself
Two feet, head first
eyes on the top shelf

Watching you paint
dust on a 
blank canvas
by yourself

Dust settles on the shelf

I'll trade 
all my dreams 
for a still life

I'm loosing touch
Watching it solidify

And when we cross that line
Every eye is upon you

I'm loosing touch
