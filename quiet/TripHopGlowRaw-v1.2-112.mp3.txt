Every lines is straight
and your cheeks glow
Nothing will stick
Nothing can grow

Still every
eye is upon you

Dreams drift farther away
each time night calls
Dreams drift farther away

in a night full of stars
in a night  
Won't you let go?

I'll find infite ways
In which I'll berate myself
Two feet, head first
eyes to the top shelf

Waiting for
blank canvas
dream, dust
settles on the shelf

I'll trade 
all my dreams 
for a still life

(to sat-is-fy)

(but) I'm loosing touch
Watching it solidify

And when we cross that line
Every eye is upon you
