      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Creating songs is difficult. Not just the practical side, finding time and head space.
        The idea was clear. Triphop with a 90ties flair. I developed a unhealthy obsession with Del Naja's vocal style.
        I had a beat going. Several polished layers of synths and keys.
        When it came to tracking and recording vocals, the project just tanked. I found no way of getting the sound I wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started cleaning my desktop and stumbled upon an earlier half finished project. Even if created just a few months in advance, I have no idea what they are and what my plan was then. Itâ€™s alien.
        Like it was created by a different person. It's full of ackward drones, a bit shrill but definitely in the foreground.
        I start merging the two projects, it became darker than what I had planned. But when my spoken/whispered vocals came on top; it clicked this time.</p>

      <h3>About notoms</h3>
      <p>notoms is the creative alias of Thomas Kjelsrud, a restless soul navigating the balance between fatherhood, a full-time software engineering career, and his artistic pursuits.
        Music is his outlet, a nightly practice driven by internal restlessness, anxiety, and occasional moments of joy.
        </p><p>His sound circles around ambient, eerie themes, often built on synths and samplers, while weaving in guitar, bass, and his distinct vocal style, which sits somewhere between singing and spoken word.

        Though notoms occasionally plays light gigs and collaborates with bands, his true focus is in solo production, where he creates music meant to provoke thought and introspection. His work blends atmospheric textures that are both soothing and unsettling, providing a soundscape for contemplation and wonder. Always abstract, yet with a subtle drive, notoms invites listeners into a world where the eerie and the calming coexist.</p>
