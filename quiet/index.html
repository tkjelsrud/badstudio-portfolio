      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Creating songs is difficult. Not just the practical side, finding time and head space.
        The idea was clear. Triphop with a 90ties flair. I developed a unhealthy obsession with Del Naja's vocal style.
        I had a beat going. Several polished layers of synths and keys.
        When it came to tracking and recording vocals, the project just tanked. I found no way of getting the sound I wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started cleaning my desktop and stumbled upon an earlier half finished project. Even if created just a few months in advance, I have no idea what they are and what my plan was then. Itâ€™s alien.
        Like it was created by a different person. It's full of ackward drones, a bit shrill but definitely in the foreground.
        I start merging the two projects, it became darker than what I had planned. But when my spoken/whispered vocals came on top; it clicked this time.</p>
