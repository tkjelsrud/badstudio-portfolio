these streets are so cold
a few light remains

online, 
everything is wrapped in plastic
its in our music 
its in my drink
plastic music

we spent o so
much .. grooming you
i cant tell you appart 


intro:
noise, panning, like cymbals
then BDs pitch down: dun dun Dun

let me be perfectly clear
grab your attention
then
dissapear

BD: like; ra ratata tam. 

(nag for an hour)
drag you around
and leave you there

...
all about atmosphere 

capture the essence
of a couples quarrel
in the kitchen (dripping)
throwing plates
girls that leave or show up late

hide my clothes in the bin
cover the smell, clearly
someone else's skin

i rose to the situation
i can choose what paint
percentage matt
pick based on feelings
then show restraint

remodel our life around 
a new style
cant diaagree on whats in
magazines

almost makes me not
depressed

stressed
i know im faithless
i know in blessed

all about atmosphere 
where i find my rest

dreams we dare
make people we don't know stare

dreams of the past
how long last

writing a message
then never send

dress rehearsals
for another clash
echoes recorded
in a quiet flash
