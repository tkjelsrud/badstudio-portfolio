there is a next

and its here

nowhere to be found

let me be perfectly clear
grab your attention
then
dissapear

(nag for an hour)
drag you around
and leave you there

music for throwing plates
that I worship deamons
leave then show up late

what's the hurry
there's always the next worry

kind of nostalgic
always kind
to kind souls

almost makes me not
depressed

the sun never rose
but it's warm and wet all year
there used to be snow
