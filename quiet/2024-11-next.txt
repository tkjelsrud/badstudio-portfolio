there is a next

and its here

nowhere to be found

let me be perfectly clear
grab your attention
then
dissapear

(nag for an hour)
drag you around
and leave you there

capture the essence
of couples quarrel
in the kitchen (dripping)
throwing plates
leave or show up late

hide my clothes in the bin
cover the smell, clearly
someone else's skin

i rose to the situation
i can choose what paint
percentage matt
pick on feelings
 then show restraint

remodel our life around 
a new style
cant diaagree on
magazines




almost makes me not
