I have to have the
upper hand

Sedate yourself
It's ok, now
you can

My mind (it)
breathes clear

Drag you around
for a while
then leave you
here

audiable smear
not exactly shakespear
gear
 
cause
these streets are stone cold
(so cold)
through my bones

I've ... tenfold
Ambitions unsold
strangling to get
a foothold




I see clearly
though I'm turbulent
and I see;

everything is wrapped in plastic
its in our souls
its in my drink
plastic music
complete the chart

(cause we) spent all our
time grooming you
now we can't tell you apart 
like you're a clone
bubbling drone
full-blown ...
well-known

your young, so young
you have no direction
now sedate, faste through
inflection

i see clearly through the turbulence

I have to have the upper hand
You kept on payment plans
Your opinion matters.
Mine more
The right are not right enough
(far right)

intro:
noise, panning, like cymbals
then BDs pitch down: dun dun Dun

let me be perfectly clear
grab your attention
then
dissapear

BD: like; ra ratata tam. 

(nag for an hour)
drag you around
and leave you there

...
(all about atmosphere )

capture the essence
of a couples quarrel
in the kitchen (dripping)
throwing plates
girls that leave or show up late

hide my clothes in the bin

i rose to the situation
i can choose what paint
percentage matt
pick based on feelings
then show restraint

remodel our life around 
a new style
cant diaagree on whats in
magazines

almost makes me not
depressed

stressed
i know im faithless
i know in blessed

all about atmosphere 
where i find my rest

dreams we dare
make people we don't know stare

dreams of the past
how long last

writing a message
then never send

dress rehearsals
for another clash
echoes recorded
in a quiet flash
