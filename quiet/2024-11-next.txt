there is a next

and its here

nowhere to be found

let me be perfectly clear
grab your attention
then
dissapear

(nag for an hour)
drag you around
and leave you there

...
all about atmosphere 

capture the essence
of a couples quarrel
in the kitchen (dripping)
throwing plates
girls that leave or show up late

hide my clothes in the bin
cover the smell, clearly
someone else's skin

i rose to the situation
i can choose what paint
percentage matt
pick based on feelings
then show restraint

remodel our life around 
a new style
cant diaagree on whats in
magazines

almost makes me not
depressed

stressed
i know im faithless
i know in blessed

all about atmosphere 
where i find my rest

dreams we dare
make people we don't know stare

dreams of the past
how long last

writing a message
then never send

dress rehearsals
for another clash
echoes recorded
in a quiet flash
