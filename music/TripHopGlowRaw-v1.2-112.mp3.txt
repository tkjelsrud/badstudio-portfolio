Every lines is straight
and your cheeks glow

Nothing will stick
Nothing can grow

Still every
eye is upon you

Dreams drift farther away
each time night calls

We build our world
out of stars

Yet we expect more

I'll find infite ways
In which I'll berate myself

But look, landed good
My head is on the top shelf

(And when we cross that line?)

I'll trade all my dreams for a still life

I'm loosing touch
Watching it solidify

And when we cross that line
Every eye is upon you
