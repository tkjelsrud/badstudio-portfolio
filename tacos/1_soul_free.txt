Soul free, Notoms 2024

(instrumental)

close, underneath my skin
chemicals light the way

impossible
remolding my path

i'm looking out for him
is he looking out for me?

soul, free
(i'm becoming) a darker me

(instrumental, vokalharmonier)

high
too high
to fall down
and fall apart
and when I do
he's here
he's here
