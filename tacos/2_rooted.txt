Rooted, Notoms 2024

lost within, and we don't change
'cause this path is leading, nowhere

linger as these clouds roll by
they're scattered, like me
everywhere

before time leaves us here, behind
there will be something here, for me

(instrumental)

we were stuck, in a daze
'cause our path, it leads us
right here

we flow like leaves, off ground
bound to end up fallen, everywhere

before time leaves us here, behind
there will be something here, for me

(instrumental)
